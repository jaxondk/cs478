# cs478 - Intro to Machine Learning

This repository represents the work completed in my senior level ML class. There are several branches, usually multiple ones for each lab. The class introduced me to several ML models and concepts, and each lab was implementing a ML model by hand in python. This gave me a greater depth of understanding of these models than simply using existing models would have.
